## ðŸŒ€ Drainage & Venting

### Catch Drain
An inlet designed to capture and direct surface water or runoff from open areas into the drainage system.

### Backflow Barrier
A device or system component used to stop the reverse flow of water or contaminants into the potable supply.

### Branch Air Vent
A pipe that connects individual fixture vents to a common vertical venting line.

### Building Drainage Piping
The lowest portion of the internal piping system that collects waste from all branches and directs it toward the external sewer line. This may handle:
- **Sanitary Waste**: Human or household waste.
- **Storm Runoff**: Rainwater or surface drainage.
- **Combined Waste**: Both sanitary and stormwater.

### Building Sewer Line
The external piping that extends from the building drainage outlet to a designated disposal location, such as a municipal sewer, septic system, or other treatment facility. This includes:
- **Sanitary Sewer**: Carries only waste from toilets and sinks.
- **Storm Sewer**: Carries only runoff from rain or snow.
- **Combined Sewer**: Carries both sanitary and stormwater.

### Subdrain
A piping segment within the drainage system that relies on mechanical or alternative means to transport waste when gravity flow isn't possible.

### Sewer Trap
A configuration or device installed in the building drain to block the exchange of gases between the drainage system and the building's interior.

### Loop Vent
A vent connected to a horizontal drain that serves multiple fixtures, typically arranged in a loop or battery format.

### Wet Vent System
A specially configured waste and vent pipe system that allows air to flow freely above the waste line, enabling the drainage of multiple fixtures through shared piping.

### Fixture Intersection Vent
A vent placed where two fixture drains join, serving both fixtures simultaneously.

### Trap Seal Depth
The vertical measurement of water held in a trap that prevents air or gas passage.

### Waste Line
Any pipe in a drainage system that conveys used water or waste materials.

### Internal Drainage Network
All piping within a structure that channels sewage, stormwater, or liquid waste to a disposal point, not including public sewer infrastructure.
- **Gravity System**: Operates by gravitational force.
- **Sanitary System**: Excludes stormwater.
- **Storm System**: Handles rain and runoff.

### Emergency Overflow Drain
A floor drain designed to manage accidental water discharge from fixtures or pipes, not connected to any active plumbing use.

### Grease Waste Line
Piping intended to handle discharge containing grease, typically from food service areas or kitchens.

### Horizontal Drain Branch
A lateral pipe that receives waste from multiple fixtures and conveys it toward a vertical stack or building drain.

### Vent Pipe
A vertical or inclined pipe that provides airflow to and from the drainage system to preserve trap seals.

### Trap Device
A curved or looped fitting designed to hold a small amount of liquid to block sewer gases.

### Trap Water Seal
The distance between the trap's overflow edge and its lowest water-retaining point.

### Stack
Any vertical pipe that serves soil, waste, or vent functions and spans multiple building levels.

### Stack Extension
The portion of a soil or waste stack above the highest branch connection.

### Stack-Based Venting
The method of venting fixtures via the vertical stack itself.

### Underground Water Collector
A drain designed to collect water from beneath the ground surface.

### Ejector Vent
A separate air outlet for sewage ejectors or similar equipment.

### Relief Air Vent
A vent installed to balance air pressure between various sections of the plumbing system.

### Roof Water Drain
A fixture on a roof that captures rainwater and channels it into vertical drainage systems.

### Main Vent Stack
A vertical pipe installed primarily to manage airflow throughout the drainage system.

### Ventilation Network
A connected series of pipes that supply air to or vent gases from the plumbing system to protect trap integrity.

### Gray Waste
Used water from sources not containing human waste, such as sinks and bathtubs.

### Indirect Drain Receptor
A floor-mounted unit designed to receive discharge from indirect waste pipes.
