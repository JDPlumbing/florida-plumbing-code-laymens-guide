### Primary Distribution Line  
The main artery in a plumbing or piping network.

### Plumbing Accessory  
A non-primary fixture or component attached to the plumbing system, often preassembled.

### Medical Gas Supply  
A complete setup to deliver gases (e.g., oxygen) from a central storage point to patient-use outlets.

### Medical Vacuum Line  
A system for providing suction to patient-use areas through a network of pipes and equipment.

### Health Hazard Condition  
Any unsafe or unsanitary condition that could harm occupants or users.

### Pipe Offset  
A combination of angled fittings used to change direction while keeping parallel alignment.

### Open Environment  
Any location exposed to outdoor air.

### Plumbing Scope  
The discipline involving installation and maintenance of water supply and waste systems in or around structures.

### Plumbing Accessory  
A non-water-demanding device used in conjunction with plumbing fixtures to improve system performance.

### Plumbing Network  
A full system of water supply, waste removal, traps, vents, and drainage, including fixtures and appurtenances.

### Water Quality Impairment  
A degradation of potable waterâ€™s taste or appearance without posing a direct health risk.

### Private Fixture Classification  
Fixtures in areas with limited access, not open to the general public.

### Public Fixture Classification
