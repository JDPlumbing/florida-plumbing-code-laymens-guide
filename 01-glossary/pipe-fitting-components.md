## ðŸ§± Piping & Fittings

### Coupler Fitting  
A connector that allows pipes of different types or sizes to be securely joined.

### Air Inlet Valve  
A mechanical one-way valve that permits air into the drainage system to prevent trap siphoning.

### Air Break (Waste)  
A discharge arrangement where waste enters a receptor below its flood level but above the trap seal.

### Air Gap (Waste)  
The open vertical space between a waste pipe outlet and the receiving container's rim.

### Air Gap (Water Supply)  
A vertical separation between a faucet and a fixture's flood level to prevent contamination.

### Sewer Check Valve  
A valve that prevents waste from backing up into a buildingâ€™s plumbing system.

### Gravity Drain Pipe  
A sloped pipe that conveys captured nonpotable or stormwater to a tank using gravity.

### Waste Discharge Pipe  
A pipe designed to carry wastewater away from fixtures.

### Waste Line Fittings  
Specialized connectors used in waste systems to ensure smooth flow and avoid clogs.

### Tank Fill Valve  
A float-controlled valve that refills a toilet tank after flushing, often with anti-siphon features.

### Flush Valve (Pressurized)  
A direct-discharge valve connected to a pressurized supply line, controlling flush quantity and velocity.

### Full Bore Valve  
A shutoff valve that, when open, offers no restriction to flow through the system.

### Horizontal Pipe  
A pipe or fitting angled less than 45Â° from the horizontal plane.

### Indirect Waste Connector  
A pipe that discharges waste indirectly into the drainage system through an open receptor.

### Press-to-Connect Joint  
A mechanical seal created with a special pressing tool, used for fast and permanent connections.

### Push-Fit Connector  
A mechanical fitting that seals pipes by inserting them into the fitting with no additional tools.

### Snap-Action Valve  
A fast-closing valve designed to shut off water quickly to prevent hammering.

### Soil Waste Pipe  
A pipe that carries human waste from toilets to the building drain or sewer.

### Ventilation Conduit  
A component of the vent system that ensures proper air movement within the plumbing network.

### Vertical Pipe  
A pipe or fitting angled 45Â° or more from the horizontal.

### Waste Drain Pipe  
A pipe that carries only liquid waste (not containing fecal matter).

### Compression-Type Joint  
A mechanical connection relying on axial force for a tight seal, often part of a coupling or adapter.
