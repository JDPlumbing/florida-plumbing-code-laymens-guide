## ðŸ’§ Water Supply

### Onsite Nonpotable Source
Water derived from sources like rainwater, graywater, or system rejections, intended for reuse but not for drinking.

### Recirculating Hot Water Loop
A system where hot water continuously circulates through supply lines using a pump to provide immediate hot water at fixtures.

### On-Demand Recirculation System
A hot water delivery setup that activates recirculation only when hot water is requested, improving efficiency.

### Operating Pressure
The pressure measured in a supply pipe while water is actively flowing through an open outlet.

### Pressurized Flush Tank
A system combining an air chamber with water to deliver high-velocity flushing without a traditional tank.

### Graywater
Used water from sinks, bathtubs, and laundry that doesnâ€™t contain toilet discharge and is potentially reusable.

### Grid-Connected Plumbing
A water supply network where pipes are interconnected to offer multiple flow paths to fixtures.

### Heated Water
Water with a temperature of at least 110Â°F (43Â°C), generally supplied to showers, sinks, or appliances.

### Private Water Source
A water supply serving individual properties or small communities not regulated as a public system.

### Usage Meter
A device that tracks and records the amount of water consumed over time.

### Non-Drinking Water
Water that is not safe or intended for human consumption or culinary use.

### Reuse System
A setup for collecting, treating, and reusing water generated onsite, such as graywater systems.

### Potable Water
Water safe for human consumption, meeting health standards for microbial and chemical purity.

### Public Utility Main
A water conduit installed and managed by local government or utility providers, typically located in public areas.

### Rain Catchment
Water from precipitation captured for storage and later use.

### Treated Wastewater
Effluent that has undergone purification and is reused, typically for irrigation or industrial purposes.

### Surface Runoff
Precipitation that flows over surfaces and may be collected for nonpotable use.

### Warm Water
Water maintained within a moderate temperature range, usually between 85Â°F and 110Â°F.

### Chilled Water Fountain
A water-dispensing fixture that includes a cooling element to reduce the temperature of the water.

### Water Bottle Dispenser
A fixture that releases potable water into containers such as cups or bottles.

### Municipal Supply Main
The principal public pipeline distributing potable water across a service area.

### Water Discharge Point
An outlet through which water flows to supply a fixture or appliance.

### Supply Line Network
The entire system of pipes, fittings, valves, and connectors delivering water within or around a building.

### Surge Suppressor
A device designed to mitigate the effects of sudden pressure increases (water hammer) in a plumbing system.

### Water Heater Unit
An appliance or system that heats potable water for domestic or commercial use and distributes it through the hot water supply.
