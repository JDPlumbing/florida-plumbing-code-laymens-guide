Preface
This project started as a side effort to fix something that’s been bothering me for years: the Florida Plumbing Code is legally binding, but unless you pay for an ICC subscription or know how to dig through technical-ese, it’s almost impossible to actually read. That’s a problem — especially for regular folks trying to do right by their homes and families.

This version strips the legal jargon and replaces it with plain language. It’s not a substitute for the official codebook, and it’s not legal advice. But it is an accessible reference: for homeowners, for DIYers, and for anyone who just wants to check whether the “deal” they're being offered sounds like BS.

If this helps even one person avoid a botched install or a dishonest contractor, it’s worth it.

Plumbing affects safety, health, and wallets. Understanding the basics shouldn’t require a subscription, a license, or a lawyer.
