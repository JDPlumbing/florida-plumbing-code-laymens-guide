## General Regulations

This chapter sets the ground rules for how plumbing must be installed across the board — even if later chapters go into specifics.

### Key Points:

- **Plumbing Installations Must Be Safe:** Don’t damage walls or structure during install. Support everything properly.

- **Fixtures Must Drain Properly:** Every plumbing fixture needs to be connected to the drainage system.

- **Prohibited Connections:**
  - Don’t connect waste pipes directly to drinking water pipes.
  - No cross-connections unless there's backflow protection.

- **Installation Must Be Permanent:** Don’t rely on temporary hoses or flexible tubing where permanent 
pipe is required. 

- **Protect Against Freezing & Damage:** Pipes must be insulated or protected if they might freeze.

- **Water Hammer Arrestors:** Install these at quick-closing valves (like washing machines) to prevent banging pipes.

- **Pipe Support Required:** Pipes must be supported at regular intervals so they don’t sag or break.

- **Marking & Identification:** Pipes should be labeled so you know what they carry (especially if multiple systems run together).

- **Toxic Materials Banned:** Don’t use lead or other harmful substances where they could contact potable water.

### Tips:
- Use mechanical sleeves or shields where pipes go through metal studs or framing.
- Protect against corrosion when dissimilar metals touch (like copper and galvanized).
