## Fixtures, Faucets & Fixture Fittings
This chapter covers everything about the **things people interact with**: sinks, toilets, faucets, and how many are required.

### Key Points:

#### General Rules:

- Every building must have enough fixtures (toilets, sinks, etc.) based on how it’s used (home, business, etc.).

- Fixtures must be made from durable, approved materials and installed to stay clean and functional.

#### What’s Not Allowed:

- No toilets that hide the trap or don’t fully rinse the bowl.

- Don’t connect a plumbing fixture in a way that risks backflow.

#### Installation Must-Haves:

- Provide proper clearance around fixtures (e.g., space around a toilet).

- Make sure fixtures drain well and have proper water supply shutoffs.

- Public restrooms need partitions and privacy setups.

#### Accessibility:

- Some fixtures must follow ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements — like height, space, and faucet type.

#### Fixture Materials:

- Must be smooth, non-absorbent, and easy to clean.

- No wood or porous materials that can rot or harbor bacteria.

#### Water Efficiency:

- Toilets and faucets must meet water-saving standards (e.g., low GPF toilets).

- No fixtures that use more water than allowed by code.

### Drippy Pro Tips:

- Use anti-scald devices in showers.

- Floor drains in commercial restrooms must be trap-primed.
