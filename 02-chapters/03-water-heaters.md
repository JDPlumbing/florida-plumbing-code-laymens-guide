## Water Heaters
This chapter covers how to install and safely operate water heaters, including combo units that heat both space and water.

### Key Points:

#### Basic Requirements:
- Water heaters must be made of approved materials and installed safely, following manufacturer instructions and code.
- They must have all required safety devices: pressure relief valves, proper venting, and shutoffs.

#### Combo Systems:
- If a water heater is used for both home heat and hot water, and it goes over 140°F, it must include a **mixing valve** to prevent scalding at faucets.

#### Temperature & Pressure (T&P) Relief:
- Every water heater needs a T&P relief valve.
- The drain line must go to an approved location (not just any bucket or floor).

#### Location Rules:
- Heaters can't be in places where leaking could cause damage unless there's a **drain pan and overflow line**.
- Some locations (like attics or garages) need extra precautions, like safety pans and elevation.

#### Access & Maintenance:
- Make sure the heater is easy to get to for inspection and service.
- Gas models must have proper combustion air and sealed venting.

### Drippy Pro Tips:
- Always install earthquake straps in seismic zones.
- Drain pans should have a 3/4" drain line run to an obvious drainage spot — not hidden behind a wall.
