## Water Supply & Distribution
This chapter explains how water (hot and cold) is brought into a building and safely distributed to fixtures.

### Key Points:

- **General Scope:** Applies to all water supply systems â€” including private wells or municipal hookups.

- **Pipe Materials:** Only approved materials (like copper, CPVC, PEX, etc.) can be used. Protect pipes from freezing, corrosion, and damage.

- **Sizing:** Pipes must be correctly sized to deliver enough pressure and flow.

- **Contamination Prevention:** Prevent cross-connections with non-potable water using backflow devices.

- **Valves & Shutoffs:** Every building needs a main shutoff and individual fixture shutoffs.

- **Insulation & Support:** Insulate hot water lines and support all pipes correctly.

- **Thermal Expansion:** Systems with check valves need expansion control like expansion tanks.



### Drippy Pro Tips:
- Label lines clearly.
- Use dielectric unions when mixing copper and steel.
