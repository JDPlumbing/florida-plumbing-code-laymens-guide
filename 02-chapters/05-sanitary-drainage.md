## Sanitary Drainage
This chapter explains how waste water (from toilets, sinks, etc.) is carried safely out of a building.

### Key Points:

- **Connections:** Buildings must connect to sewer or approved septic system.

- **Materials:** Use approved materials (PVC, ABS, cast iron). Use proper adapters when switching types.

- **Sizing:** Use Drainage Fixture Units (DFUs) to size pipes properly.

- **Slope & Flow:** Minimum 1/4" per foot slope on small pipes. Oversizing can hurt performance.

- **Cleanouts:** Required at key points for maintenance. Must be accessible.

- **No Cross Connections:** Sanitary and storm systems must stay separate.

- **Special Fixtures:** Items like washers or grinders may need extra consideration.

### Drippy Pro Tips:

- Use long sweeps, not sharp elbows.

- Always test drainage before covering or burying it.
