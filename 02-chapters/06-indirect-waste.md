## Chapter 8: Indirect & Special Waste
This chapter covers special waste lines that can’t be directly connected to the regular drain system — usually to prevent contamination or health hazards.

### Key Points:

- **What’s Covered:** Indirect waste (like from soda machines or ACs) and special waste (like acid or lab 
waste).

- **Indirect Waste Rules:** Must drain through an **air gap** into a waste receptor (e.g. mop sink, floor sink).

- **Food Equipment:** Any food-prep or cleaning equipment needs indirect waste lines.

- **Clear-Water Waste:** Appliances like water softeners must drain indirectly.

- **Special Hazards:** Chemical or acidic waste needs to be neutralized before draining.

### Drippy Pro Tips:

- Always use air gaps.

- Never hard-pipe appliances with food or chemical waste.
