## Chapter 9: Vents
This chapter explains venting â€” allowing air into the plumbing to prevent pressure issues and sewer smells.

### Key Points:

- **Purpose:** Prevents traps from being siphoned or pressurized.

- **What Must Be Vented:** Every trap and fixture.

- **Vent Types:** Individual, common, wet vent, loop vent, and AAVs (check code).

- **Sizing:** Must match fixture demand.

- **Location:** Vents must rise above the trap, slope to drain, and avoid flat sections.

- **Termination:** Must end outside, usually above the roof.

### Drippy Pro Tips:

- Use AAVs where allowed for remodels.

- Never block a vent.

- Keep vent lines short and direct if possible.
