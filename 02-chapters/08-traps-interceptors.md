## Traps, Interceptors & Separators
This chapter covers the devices that catch debris, prevent sewer gases, and separate out harmful or messy materials before they enter the plumbing system.

### Key Points:

- **Fixture Traps:** Every fixture needs a trap. No double traps. Limit trap-to-fixture distance.

- **Trap Materials:** Must be durable and corrosion-resistant.

- **Interceptors:** Required for grease, oil, sand, etc. Must be cleaned regularly.

- **Separators:** Used for industrial fluids. May need pre-treatment tanks.

### Drippy Pro Tips:

- Clean grease traps often.

- Label interceptors for easy access.
