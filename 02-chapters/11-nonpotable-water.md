## Chapter 13: Nonpotable Water Systems
This chapter covers systems that collect, treat, and use water that isn’t safe to drink — like rainwater or reclaimed water.

### Key Points:

- **What's Covered:** Collection, storage, treatment, and plumbing for reused water (rainwater, graywater, 
etc.).

- **Use Cases:** Can be used for flushing toilets, irrigation, cooling systems — not for drinking or food prep.

- **Design Standards:** Must meet code rules or use CSA B805/ICC 805 for rainwater systems.

- **System Requirements:** Must be clearly labeled, color-coded (often purple), and separated from potable lines.

- **Storage:** Tanks must be sealed, vented, and protected from contamination.

- **Backflow Protection:** Potable water backup lines must be protected with approved backflow preventers.

- **Maintenance:** Systems need regular inspection, testing, and flushing.

### Drippy Pro Tips:

- Never mix drinking water lines with reused water.

- Label all pipes clearly and follow strict cross-connection rules.
