**Note:** These rules only apply if your local code has adopted them.

### C101 – Cutting, Notching & Boring in Wood and Steel Members
#### C101.1 Joist Notching
- Ends of joists: Notches can't be deeper than 25% of joist depth.
- Top/bottom of joists: Max notch depth = 1/6 of joist depth.
- No notches allowed in the **middle third** of the joist span.
- Holes must be at least 2" from top/bottom edges and can’t be larger than 1/3 of the joist depth.
#### C101.2 Stud Cutting and Notching
- In **load-bearing walls**: Notches can't be deeper than 25% of stud width.
- In **non-load-bearing walls**: Up to 40% notching allowed.
#### C101.3 Bored Holes in Studs
- Max hole size = 40% of stud depth (60% in non-load-bearing or doubled studs).
- Holes must be at least 5/8" from the edge.
- No boring where there's also a notch in the same section.

### C101.4 Structural Steel Framing
- Any holes/notches must be **approved by a licensed structural engineer**.
### C101.5 Cold-Formed Steel (Load-Bearing)
- **Do not notch flanges or lips**.
- Holes only allowed in webs, along the centerline, with exact spacing/distance/size per engineer’s specs.
### C101.6 Cold-Formed Steel (Nonstructural)
- **No flange or lip notching** allowed.
- Holes in webs:
  - Max: 1.5" wide × 4" long
  - Must be 24" apart minimum (center-to-center)
  - Stay at least 10" away from the support end

## Pro Tips:
- If you're drilling wood: stay centered, space out your holes, and avoid doubling up with notches.
- If you're dealing with steel framing: don’t cut anything unless you’ve got engineer approval.
- These rules are here to **prevent framing failure** due to overcutting.
