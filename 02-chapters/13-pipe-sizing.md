## Appendix E: Sizing of Water Piping System

**Note:** These rules only apply if adopted by your local ordinance. This appendix explains how to correctly size water piping systems to ensure proper pressure and flow at all fixtures.

---

## 🔧 Section E101: General Concepts

- Two approved sizing methods:  
  1. **Segmented Loss Method** (detailed step-by-step)  
  2. **Table-Based Sizing** (see Table E201.1 at the end)
- You must account for:
  - Available static pressure at the supply
  - Elevation differences
  - Friction loss through meters, valves, fittings, filters, and backflow preventers
  - Fixture demand (in gallons per minute or water supply fixture units – wsfu)

---

## 📋 Section E102: Information You’ll Need

- Minimum available pressure (from water supplier)
- Friction loss from meters (ask manufacturer)
- Estimated total building demand:
  - Fixtures (use wsfu from Table E103.3(2))
  - Constant-use appliances (in GPM – e.g., sprinklers, AC, hose bibbs)

---

## 🧮 Section E103: Pipe Sizing via Segmented Loss Method

1. **Start with available pressure** from the main (Line A)
2. **Subtract losses**:
   - Required pressure at most remote fixture (Line B)
   - Losses through meter, tap, elevation, devices (Lines C–H)
3. Remaining pressure (Line J) is what’s available for pipe friction
4. Determine **pipe lengths** and trial pipe size
5. Add equivalent pipe length for fittings/valves (see Tables E.1, E103.3(6))
6. Use charts (like Figure E103.3(3)) to find expected friction loss per 100 feet
7. Multiply friction rate × pipe length to get total loss (Line K)
8. Confirm: Line J > Line K → ✅ Good. If not, resize pipes

## 🚽 Table E103.3(2): Fixture Unit Load Values

These values help you estimate the demand each fixture places on the system. Use them when summing up cold, hot, or total load in Water Supply Fixture Units (wsfu).

| Fixture                           | Cold | Hot | Total |
|------------------------------------|------|-----|-------|
| Bathroom group (flush tank)        | 2.7  | 1.5 | 3.6   |
| Bathroom group (flushometer)       | 6.0  | 3.0 | 8.0   |
| Bathtub (private)                  | 1.0  | 1.0 | 1.4   |
| Kitchen sink (residential)         | 1.0  | 1.0 | 1.4   |
| Lavatory (private)                 | 0.5  | 0.5 | 0.7   |
| Lavatory (public)                  | 1.5  | 1.5 | 2.0   |
| Laundry trays (1–3)                | 1.0  | 1.0 | 1.4   |
| Shower (private)                   | 1.0  | 1.0 | 1.4   |
| Shower (public)                    | 3.0  | 3.0 | 4.0   |
| Urinal (flush tank)                | 3.0  | —   | 3.0   |
| Urinal (flushometer)               | 5–10 | —   | 5–10  |
| Water closet (flush tank, private) | 2.2  | —   | 2.2   |
| Water closet (flushometer, public) | 10.0 | —   | 10.0  |

➡️ For other fixtures, compare them to similar types listed.

## 📊 Table E103.3(3): Estimating Total System Demand

Convert total wsfu (fixture unit total) into gallons per minute (gpm):

| Total wsfu | Demand (gpm) |
|------------|--------------|
| 10         | 14.6         |
| 20         | 19.6         |
| 30         | 23.3         |
| 50         | 29.1         |
| 100        | 43.5         |
| 200        | 65.0         |
| 300        | 85.0         |
| 500        | 124.0        |
| 1,000      | 208.0        |
| 2,000      | 325.0        |
| 3,000      | 433.0        |
| 5,000      | 593.0        |

➡️ Use this to calculate required flow for pipe sizing.

## 📐 Table E201.1: Minimum Pipe Sizes (Based on Fixture Units & Pressure)

This table shows the minimum size for water meters, service lines, and distribution pipes depending on:

- Total water supply fixture units (wsfu)
- Available pressure
- Maximum pipe run length (developed length)

**Example:**

- 3/4" meter, 3/4" distribution pipe  
  At 50–60 psi, 200-foot run → Handles up to **5** wsfu.
- 1" meter, 1" pipe  
  At 40–49 psi, 150-foot run → Handles up to **21** wsfu.

📌 Minimum water service pipe: **3/4”** (per E201.1).

## 📦 Table E202.1: Pipe Volume (Ounces per Foot)

Used when calculating water demand, heater sizing, or flushing needs:

| Pipe Type & Size      | Volume (oz/ft) |
|---------------------- |--------------- |
| 1/2" Type L Copper    | 1.55           |
| 3/4" Type L Copper    | 3.22           |
| 1" CPVC SCH 40        | 5.53           |
| 1-1/2" PEX            | 8.09           |
| 2" Copper Type K      | 20.04          |

➡️ Multiply by pipe length to find total water held in the pipe.

## 🔧 Friction Loss Reference (Valves & Fittings)

Some fittings can add major pressure loss (expressed in feet of equivalent pipe):

| Fitting            | 1" Pipe | Equivalent Feet |
|--------------------|---------|----------------|
| 90° Elbow          | 3.0 ft  |
| Tee (branch)       | 5.0 ft  |
| Swing Check Valve  | 11.2 ft |
| Globe Valve        | 25.0 ft |

👉 Use these to add to pipe length during friction calculations (Line K).
