## About This Project

This is a plain-language rewrite of the Florida Plumbing Code, designed to be readable by real people â€” not just lawyers, contractors, or ICC subscribers.

It is **not an official document**. It is **not affiliated with the ICC or the Florida Building Commission**.  
It *is* an independent, good-faith effort to make plumbing standards more accessible for:

- DIYers who want to do it right
- Homeowners checking contractor claims
- Tradespeople looking for a quick and clean reference

The original code is publicly enforceable but commercially locked behind paywalls. This version demystifies it.

## Disclaimer

This is **not** a legal document. It's a helpful guide, but **you are responsible for checking current, official code** before making final decisions â€” especially for permits, inspections, or major work.  

Use this like a cheat sheet, not gospel.
